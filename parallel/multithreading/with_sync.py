Lock class provides following methods:

- acquire([blocking]) : To acquire a lock. A lock can be blocking or non-blocking.
  - When invoked with the blocking argument set to True (the default), thread execution 
    is blocked until the lock is unlocked, then lock is set to locked and return True.
  - When invoked with the blocking argument set to False, thread execution is not blocked.
    If lock is unlocked, then set it to locked and return True else return False 
    immediately.
- release() : To release a lock.
  - When the lock is locked, reset it to unlocked, and return. 
    If any other threads are blocked waiting for the lock to become unlocked, allow 
    exactly one of them to proceed.
  - If lock is already unlocked, a ThreadError is raised.
